# Kinesislite-Streamer

Was a little unclear on the exact ask here but I just gave it my best estimation. I'm just generating mock data for the
3 types of EVENTS in the producer.py and amd generating statistics from consumer.py.

Completion times are totally random and unrelated to pickup time in created data.

Consumer.py is printing to console.

run 'kinesalite --port 7000' from terminal
run producer.py
run consumer.py
